## FAQ

#### Why the name?

I was watching the anime Death Note and couldn't really think of anything else. I needed something so here we go. If you have any suggestions, feel free to make an issue or comment on an existing issue.

#### Does this also support applying cache modifications?

No. The focus of this library is to give developers a cache library to build (server) applications with. Additionally, the Go standard library currently, at the time of this writing, does not support Bzip2 encoding. Although Gzip can be used, perhaps one day.
